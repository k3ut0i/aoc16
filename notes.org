* Notes for Mercury Practice in Advent of Code 2016

** Day1
- I am having a problem dealing with _semidet_ predicates in _main_ which is supposed to be _det_.
- src_prolog{X mod 4} is supposed to be always 0, 1, 2, or 3. So by destructuring on it I should be able to make a deterministic predicate. But I am not able to do so. How should I deal with this? I do not actually need _mod_ function, but it is a convenient way to express a circular movement. If I rolled my own function then I could have made it deterministic.
