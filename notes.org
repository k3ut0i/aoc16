* Notes for Mercury Practice in Advent of Code 2016

** Day1
- I am having a problem dealing with _semidet_ predicates in _main_ which is supposed to be _det_.
- src_prolog{X mod 4} is supposed to be always 0, 1, 2, or 3. So by destructuring on it I should be able to make a deterministic predicate. But I am not able to do so. How should I deal with this? I do not actually need _mod_ function, but it is a convenient way to express a circular movement. If I rolled my own function then I could have made it deterministic. 
#+begin_src sh :exports both :results value verbatim
  cd /home/keutoi/projects/aoc16/src/
  ./test_day1
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: End point is: 91 135
: First repeat point is: 75 - -4

** Day2
   #+begin_src sh :exports both :results value verbatim
     cd /home/keutoi/projects/aoc16/src/
     ./test_day2
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Part1 Pass: [5, 6, 8, 5, 5]
   : Part2 Co-ordinates: [0 - 1, 0 - -1, 1 - 1, -1 - -1, 0 - 0]
